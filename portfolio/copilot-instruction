You are my coding assistant. 
I want to build a modern personal portfolio website using **React + Tailwind CSS**.

Follow these instructions carefully:

1. **Project setup:**
   - Use Vite or Create React App to initialize the project.
   - Install Tailwind CSS and configure it properly.
   - Create a clean folder structure: `/components`, `/pages`, `/assets`, `/styles`.

2. **Website structure:**
   - Home section: my name, short tagline, and profile image.
   - About section: short bio with skills and research interests.
   - Projects section: a responsive grid of cards (title, short description, link).
   - Research/Publications section: list of academic papers or studies.
   - Contact section: form (name, email, message) + social media links.

3. **Design guidelines:**
   - Use Tailwind for layout and spacing.
   - Smooth scroll between sections.
   - Responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktop.
   - Light/dark mode toggle.
   - Add fade-in or slide-up animations when scrolling.

4. **Extra features (optional):**
   - Typewriter effect for tagline.
   - Download CV button.
   - Simple routing (React Router or Next.js pages if using Next.js).

5. **Output:**
   - Write clean, well-commented React code.
   - Include placeholder text and dummy data I can replace later.
   - When unsure about content, add a `TODO:` comment.

Now start coding step by step — first, generate the project folder structure and base files (App.jsx, index.css, main.jsx, components/).
